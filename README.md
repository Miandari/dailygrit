# DailyGrit - Daily Challenge Tracker

A web application for tracking habits and challenges through daily check-ins and metrics. Built as a full-stack application demonstrating modern web development practices with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase.

## What This Project Does

DailyGrit is a habit tracking application that helps users maintain consistency in their personal goals. Users can create challenges with custom metrics, log daily progress, and view their completion history through calendars and streak counters.

The application demonstrates several key technical implementations:
- Flexible metric system supporting multiple data types
- Row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation
- Real-time file uploads with image optimization
- Complex database relationships with proper normalization
- Server-side rendering and server actions in Next.js

## Why Use This Application

**For End Users:**
- Track any type of goal with customizable metrics (workouts, reading, meditation, etc.)
- See progress through visual calendars and streak tracking
- Share challenges with friends or keep them private
- Upload photos to document progress

**For Developers:**
- Reference implementation of Next.js 15 with App Router
- Example of Supabase integration with proper RLS policies
- Pattern for handling complex form validation and multi-step workflows
- Demonstration of file upload with optimization
- Implementation of authentication and authorization

## Problem Being Solved

Many people struggle to maintain consistency when working toward personal goals. Generic todo lists lack the structure and motivation needed for habit formation. This application provides:

1. Structured tracking through defined challenges and metrics
2. Visual feedback through streaks and calendars
3. Accountability through shared challenges
4. Flexibility to track any type of measurable goal

### What Makes DailyGrit Different

Unlike simple habit trackers, DailyGrit offers:

**Flexible Metric System**: Define exactly what success looks like for your challenge. Track binary yes/no completions, specific numbers (steps, minutes, calories), time durations, multiple choice selections, written reflections, or visual progress through photo uploads.

**Accountability Through Sharing**: Create public challenges that others can join, or use private invite codes for accountability groups. See your progress alongside others working toward similar goals.

**Visual Progress Tracking**: Calendar views show your consistency at a glance, with completed days, missed days, and upcoming entries clearly marked. Streak counters provide immediate feedback on your momentum.

**Smart Data Management**: All entries are securely stored with row-level security. Your data remains private unless you explicitly choose to share challenges publicly. Export capabilities allow you to own your progress data.

### Core Use Cases

- **Fitness Goals**: Track workouts, nutrition, sleep, or weight with customizable metrics
- **Learning & Development**: Monitor study time, practice sessions, or skill-building activities
- **Wellness Habits**: Log meditation, journaling, hydration, or mental health check-ins
- **Creative Projects**: Track daily writing, art creation, or music practice
- **Productivity**: Monitor deep work sessions, task completion, or time management
- **Social Accountability**: Join existing challenges or create group challenges for teams
