## Deploy to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy via CLI (Recommended)
```bash
npx vercel
```
Follow the prompts:
- Link to existing project or create new
- Select scope
- Confirm project settings

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub

1. **Push to GitHub:**

git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

2. **Connect to Vercel:**
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Click "Import Project"
- Select your GitHub repo
- Configure environment variables (see below)
- Deploy!

## Environment Variables for Vercel

Add these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://nwkwjcsezizdakpzmhlx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[Your Anon Key]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[Your Service Role Key - Optional]
```

## Post-Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Supabase Auth Settings
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
- Add your Vercel URL to:
  - Site URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
  - Redirect URLs: `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback`

### 2. Run Storage Migration
In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- This was already included in migration 20250127000016_setup_storage.sql
-- Just verify it exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'challenge-uploads';
```

### 3. Test Your Deployment
- Visit your Vercel URL
- Create an account
- Create a challenge
- Add daily entries
- Upload photos
- View progress

## Features to Use

1. **Create Your First Challenge:**
   - Go to `/challenges/create`
   - Add custom metrics
   - Set duration and start date

2. **Track Daily Progress:**
   - Visit `/dashboard/today`
   - Fill in your metrics
   - Upload progress photos

3. **View Your Progress:**

   - Track your streaks

4. **Share Challenges:**
   - Create private challenges with invite codes
   - Share codes with friends
   - Join challenges with `/challenges/join`

##  Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
- TypeScript errors are bypassed with `ignoreBuildErrors: true`
- To fix properly, run `npx supabase gen types` with proper auth

### Database Issues
- All migrations are in `/supabase/migrations`
- Run them in order in Supabase SQL Editor

### Auth Issues
- Verify redirect URLs in Supabase
- Check environment variables in Vercel

## Performance Tips

- Images are automatically optimized on upload
- Calendar data is cached client-side
- Streaks are calculated server-side

## Success!

- Create accountability challenges
- Track daily progress
- Upload progress photos
